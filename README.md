 🎨 Figma Daily UI Challenge – Tejashree

Welcome to my **Figma Daily UI Challenge Repository**!  
Every day, I create a new user interface design in Figma to improve my UI/UX skills and explore creative layouts.

## 📂Each folder contains:

- `preview.png`: Screenshot of the Figma design  
- `README.md`: Description of the UI concept

## 🎯 Goals

- Consistent practice of UI/UX design
- Learn advanced features in Figma (auto layout, components, variants, constraints)
- Build a portfolio of clean, modern interfaces
- Share and inspire others in the design community
